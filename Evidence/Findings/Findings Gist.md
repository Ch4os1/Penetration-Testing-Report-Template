- After the Executive Summary, the Findings section is one of the most important. This section gives us a chance to show off our work, paint the client a picture of the risk to their environment, give technical teams the evidence to validate and reproduce issues and provide remediation advice. 
- Primary objective should be present evidence in a way that is understandable and actionable to the client 

### Breakdown of a Finding
- Findings should cater towards each client's specific circumstances
- If a finding is written to suit several different scenarios or protocols, the finial version should be adjusted to only reference the particular circumstances we have identified 
- At a minimum the following information should be include for every finding:
	- Description of the finding and what platform(s) the vulnerability affects
	- Impact if the finding is left unresolved
	- Affected systems, networks, environments, or applications
	- Recommendation for how to address the problem
	- Reference links with additional information about the finding and resolving it
- Some additional, optional fields include:
	- CVE
	- OWASP, MITRE IDs
	- CVSS or similar score 
	- Ease of exploitation and probability of attack
	- Any other information that might help learn about and mitigate the attack
